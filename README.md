# Jive

Jive is a web based application that randomly generates activites or ideas to do in your spare time so that the user has to do as little thinking as possible. Tailored to the user's preferences, a user can choose to do something right at that instant, or plan for a whole day! After answering a few initial preference questions, the application stores the information to give great suggestions. Also, Jive uses a lot of pre-existing technology to add to the user's expierence.
