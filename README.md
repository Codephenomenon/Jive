We all know how busy life can get. And so when you FINALLY get a day all to yourself you probably are not too sure on how to spend it. We here at 'Mules Team 3 LLC' found this happening all too often so we developed Jive! Jive is a fun new way to plan a day, without even thinking! Simply click register and you can start Jiving. Also, users have the option to log in with with their Facebook or Google account.

Jive will start by asking the user to answer a few inital questions. These questions will allow us to optimize what kind of random days the user will be given. For example: favorite kind of food, average dispospal income, etc. Please note that the user can opt to reanswer these preference questions in the settings menu. 

After these intial preference questions are answered the user is given a choice. They can either choose 'Plan now' or 'Plan tomorrow'. If the user chooses 'Plan Now', the application will return the user's time and give an activity based off the current time. For example, if the user clicked 'Plan Now' at 5pm, the app could say "Dinner at Olive Garden?". Or it could say, "The KC Chiefs are playing right now, care to watch?". If the user selects 'Plan Tomorrow', the application will give an agenda for the entire day. From eating cereal in the morning to ice skating at night! The sky is the limit with Jive!

Since Jive knows that the user will not always like the first option given, a user can reroll an option at any time. This function works for the 'Plan tomorrow' feature, users can keep some options, and reroll others. Thus creating a fun day without making you think about what to do. 

Another key feature to Jive is expierence. Jive uses a series of API's to maximize the user's enjoyment. By allowing the user to login to Facebook or Google the user is saved from making another pesky account. Another key API we use is Yelp. That way the user is statstically more likely to get venues and activites that are liked more by the community. 

Jive is a web-based application written in HTML, CSS, JS, along with React, Redux, Express, MongoDB, PassportJS, Mongoose, BeCrypt, Validator.
